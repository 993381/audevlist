### A simple cli tool for Mac to display all the audio output devices including their device ID's for AudioUnit ###

You can grab the binary from the downloads, enjoy

**use at your own risk, it works pretty solidly though**

I plan to integrate it with libao or make a separate brew, I'll update here when I do.
